# Titans

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.2.

To run

This is a very basic version, so the assembly files that are uploaded should not contain tabs(i.e, \t). Instead use spaces(i.e, " ") only, instead of tabs.
All the operations that are needed to implement a bubble sort along with the specified ones are included. The operations are:
1. add, addi
2. sub, srl, sw
3. mul
4. div
5. bne, beq, blt
6. j
7. lw, la, li 

For the bubble sort, the output of an array is shown below the code editor.
The Assembly code for bubble sort is also uploaded with filename "bubble_sort".

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
